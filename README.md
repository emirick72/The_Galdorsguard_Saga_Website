# The Galdorsguard Saga Website

## Welcome to the world of Sathera!

### About
*The Galdorsguard Saga* is my original series of WIP high fantasy novels. This website acts as a centralized location for everything related to TGS, including worldbuilding, characters, writings, and art.

The series is mainly inspired by DND and other fantasy/sci-fi media, such as *The Dragon Prince*, *She-ra and the Princesses of Power*, *Star Wars: The Bad Batch*, *The Mandalorian*, *The Legend of Vox Machina*, *The Mighty Nein*, and *The Inheritance Cycle*.

I wanted to make this website not only for having a centralized location for the lore, but also to practice my web development skills outside of college and combine my love for coding, art, and writing.
